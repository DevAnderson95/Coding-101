# Python refers to values that cannot change as immutable, and an immutable list is called a tuple

#writing over a tuple

#The block atudefines the original tuple and prints the initial dimen- sions. Atv, we store a new tuple in the variable dimensions. We then print the new dimensions atw. Python doesnâ€™t raise any errors this time, because overwriting a variable is valid:
#always remember to use a tuple only when you want to store a variable/list to use later in your code(program)
