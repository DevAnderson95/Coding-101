#the (for) loop takes a code and runs in through a series of conditions determining if True/False
#the (while) loop can be used to to count up through a series of numbers 
current_number = 1 
while current_number <= 30:
    print(current_number)
    current_number += 1 

#(while) loops will be used in almost every program to keep its functions running for a long as we would like it to
